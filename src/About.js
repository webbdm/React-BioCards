        <div className="about-info">
            <p>Born and raised in Wichita, Kansas, I grew up making trips out West hiking & snowboarding through the Rockies. I also had a passion for music & entertainment, which led me to Nashville in 2011 when I enrolled at Belmont University for music business. When I discovered the music &  incredible outdoor adventures Tennessee had to offer, I knew it was the place for me.</p>

            <p>Working in entertainment marketing, I found myself assisting with & managing numerous artist and brand websites. The moment I started delving into the code, it sparked an instant zeal to learn the craft of creating visually impressive and immersive websites.</p>

            <p>After 2 years of continued work in marketing, web development became something I did not because it was work, but because it was my passion. To me, itâ€™s like solving a giant puzzle or having a Lego set with endless possibilities. This led me to enroll at Nashville Software School for 2017 and sharpen my skills as a full-stack developer. </p>

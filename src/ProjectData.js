        "description": "Trek was my Front-End capstone for Nashville Software School, and the first full-fledged web application I ever built. The inspiration for this wiki-style campsite & park database was my love of backpacking. Sometimes itâ€™s hard to find locations & reviews for very specific campsites, especially if they are in the backcountry. Trek allows you to search for campsites by park, and add photos, comments, reviews, and coordinates to display the exact location with Google Maps. It was built with Angular 1.6, the Google Maps Javascript API, and Firebase.",
